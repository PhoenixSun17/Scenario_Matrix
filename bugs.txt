bugs
- sum should not ask for size second time
	- might need to tweak getusermat to take an integer, and ask for integer before calling getusermat
- matrices are not sanitized to be 2x2 or 3x3 strictly
	- 
- add secret 6,7 options as check for answer and comment 
	- could even be 99 or 100 or some weirdly specific number to prevent user input
